# OSTEP Notes and Examples

---

This repository is a host of the notes I took and examples I completed while reading
[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/).

The author of OSTEP listed these repositories to help with one's conceptual 
understanding of the topics discussed in the book.
